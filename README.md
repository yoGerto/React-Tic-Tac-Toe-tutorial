I am working on completing the stretch goals which are listed at the end of the tutorial. 
I hope these will help me get a better understanding of how to structure React code and how to code in JavaScript.
So far I have learnt some useful things about some core concepts such as mutability, code scope, lifting props to a higher level and the general concept of components in JavaScript.
I hope to develop this skill further to create a User Interface for a personal website.
